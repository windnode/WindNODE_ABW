,Description
none,No battery storage capacity considered for balancing at system level. Existing PV home storage systems are neglected
BAT,Battery storage capacity by plain scaling of battery storage capacity by RES capacity of particular generation capacity data in the scenario
BAT+,Increased capacity compared to BAT using max. available RES capacity in the region.
BAT++,Largely increased capacity compared to BAT+. Applies to scenario ISE_RE-_AUT90_DSM++_BAT++_PTH++ only to allow for 90 percent autarky
