Land eligibility for RE
=======================

The subject of this chapter is the analysis of land eligibility for wind energy and photovoltaics.

We identified several issues in workshops with local stakeholders, which we will address in this chapter. First, the
land use - especially for wind energy - became a key matter of debate in Germany and, to the same extend, in the ABW
region as the number of wind turbines have been growing dramatically during the last decades. On the one hand,
renewables are perceived as a key element of the energy transition. Superordinate targets set by the federal government
have to be implemented on a local level. On the other hand, regional concerns should be considered as the designation of
wind turbine sites by regional planning authorities and their realization crucially depend on the acceptance of the
people living in the surroundings of those sites. This matter of conflict motivates the question: "To what extent can
the region be supplied by renewables considering the available area?"

Wind energy
-----------

Wind energy makes the largest contribution to renewable power generation in the ABW region. In the end of 2017, 438
turbines with an installed capacity of 717 megawatts already covered around 45% of the regional electricity demand.
The further expansion and repowering of existing plants plays an important role in the transformation of the energy
system in the region according to the climate and energy concept of the state of Saxony-Anhalt :cite:`MULE2019`.

Wind turbines are privileged according to §35 BauGB. However, it is necessary to consider important concerns such as
nature and resident protection as well as the control of wind energy planning by designating so-called concentration
areas in regional and land use plans with preclusive effects in the remaining planning area :cite:`BWE2019`.
In the ABW region, it is the responsibility of the regional planning authority
(*Regionale Planungsgemeinschaft Anhalt-Bitterfed-Wittenberg*) to designate such priority areas (VR/EG, German:
Vorrang-/Eignungsgebiete), the *Teilplan Wind ABW 2018* can be found in :cite:`ABW2018a`. The planning area
includes the districts of Wittenberg, Anhalt-Bitterfeld and the independent city of Dessau-Roßlau :cite:`ABW2018b`.

In a nutshell, so-called "strict" and "weak" restriction areas are excluded from the planning area, which are not
available for wind energy use for various reasons (e.g. nature conservation, existing infrastructure, other interests,
etc.). This results in potentially eligible areas - the so-called "search area" - which account for around 10% of the
entire planning area. These areas are subject to a case-by-case examination, which leads to an exclusion of about 90% of
the search area. As a result, approx. 1 % of the planning area is still available for the designation of VR/EG as shown
in :numref:`re_wind_diagram`; 3590 ha (0.98 %) were actually designated as VR/EG :cite:`ABW2018a`.

The individual steps are described in the following subsections.

Restriction areas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Regulations and assumptions on the restriction areas are taken from :cite:`ABW2018a`, :cite:`UBA2013`, :cite:`BMVI2015`
as well as the current legislation in force. The restriction areas include:

:"Strict" restrictions:

    * Settlements (+500 m buffer)
    * Existing infrastructure such as roads, railway tracks, airfields
    * Nature conservation areas
    * Protected landscape elements (German: Geschützte Landschaftsbestandteile)
    * Special protection areas (SPA)
    * Drinking water protection areas: zones I+II

      (Bechstein's bat and greater mouse-eared bat)
    * Landscape protection areas
    * Nature parks

      Wassergewinnung)
    * Priority and reserved areas for agriculture (German: Vorrang- und Vorbehaltsgebiete für die Landwirtschaft)
    * Priority and reserved areas for raw materials production (German: Vorrang- und Vorbehaltsgebiete für die
      Rohstoffgewinnung)
    * Municipal planning and planning intentions, natural scenery, private concerns
    * Existing infrastructure
        * Highways (+100 m buffer)
        * Federal roads (+80 m buffer)
        * State and municipal roads (+20 m buffer)
        * Railway tracks (+250 m buffer)
        * Railway properties
        * Airports and airfields (+1760 m buffer for civil use, +6 km buffer for military use)
        * High voltage overhead lines (+120 m buffer)
        * Ground-mounted PV plants

Further assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the allocation of wind turbines we make use of a greenfield approach based upon the calculated potential areas,
hence the age structure of existing turbines as well as repowering at existing sites are neglected. Instead, an average
land use of 20 hectares per turbine (:cite:`MLV2018`, :cite:`UBA2013`, :cite:`BMWi2017a`) is assumed.

An Enercon E-141 (4.2 MW) with a hub height of 159 m is used as model turbine in all future scenarios.

Results
^^^^^^^

Results are evaluated with regard to two central parameters, distance to settlements and the use of forest areas, which
are subject of the current political and public debate. The current legislation prescribes a distance to settlements of
1000 m in Saxony-Anhalt :cite:`LSA2015`, :cite:`FAwind2021`. Additionally, 500 m and 1500 m are used to evaluate how a
decreased or increased distance would affect the total available area. Results are shown in the following table, the
regulatory status quo (designated wind priority areas - *VR/EG*, cf. above) is given as reference.

An analysis of the results is given in the end of this chapter: :ref:`re_results_land_use`.

Ground-mounted photovoltaics
----------------------------

Ground-mounted photovoltaic systems, with an installed capacity of 445 MW and a share of around 18 % of the region's
electricity demand, were already making a substantial contribution by the end of 2017. Further expansion is an important
component on the way to a completely renewable energy supply, which must be carried out in consideration of their
spatial and environmental impact.

The underlying methodology is presented in :numref:`re_pv_diagram`: following the support scheme for ground-mounted PV
according to §37 EEG (2017) potential areas are determined. Along the lines to determine eligible areas for wind energy
as presented above, restrictive areas of different relevance are subtracted to gain the final eligible areas.

   Calculation of eligible areas for ground-mounted PV

Potential areas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following potential areas are considered:

:110 m strips along federal highways and railway tracks:

    A 110 m buffer zone along federal highways and railway tracks, less a 40 m zone around federal highways (§9 FStrG)
    and 10 m zone for railway tracks :cite:`FraunhoferIEE2019` is used. A width of 24 m (federal highways) and 12 m
    (railroads) is assumed.

:Soils with low arable yield potential (soil quality):

    Large land potentials can be found in the agricultural areas. Following :cite:`ZSW2019`, areas with low arable yield
    potential (soil quality) are used. For this purpose, the arable land and meadows from *Corine Land Cover*
    :cite:`CLC2018` are intersected with the areas of very and extremely low soil quality (<50) according to the
    *Soil Quality Rating* of the *Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources* :cite:`Stange2011`.

    In the current planning, according to the climate and energy concept of the state of Saxony-Anhalt :cite:`MULE2019`,
    "the construction of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems on agricultural land should be avoided as far as possible".
    In order to take this limitation into account, according to :cite:`ZSW2019` only 0.5..1.0 % are assumed to be
    available as "spatially compatible" (German: raumverträglich verfügbar).

Other sites included in the EEG's subsidy scheme - conversion areas (German: Konversionsflächen) and federally owned
properties - are neglected due to their comparatively low potential and insufficient data availability.

   :align: center

Restriction areas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The potential areas are opposed by restriction areas in which the construction of photovoltaic plants is excluded
(strict restrictions) or unlikely (weak restrictions). Both the current legal situation and planning criteria are taken
into account following the methodology of :cite:`BMVI2015`.

:"Strict" restrictions:

    * Settlements (+100 m buffer)
    * Existing infrastructure
        * Federal highways (24 m width, +40 m buffer)
        * Federal, state and municipal roads (+20 m buffer)
        * Railway tracks (12 m width, +10 m buffer)
    * Railway properties
    * Airports and airfields
    * Standing water bodies and rivers (+20 m buffer)
    * Forest (+100 m buffer)
    * Nature conservation areas
    * Biosphere reserves
    * Floodplains
    * Natural monuments (German: Flächennaturdenkmale)
    * Drinking water protection areas: zones I+II
    * Further restrictions imposed by the *Regional development plan* :cite:`ABW2018b`:
        * Priority and reserved areas for agriculture (German: Vorrang- und Vorbehaltsgebiete für die Landwirtschaft)
        * Priority and reserved areas for raw materials production (German: Vorrang- und Vorbehaltsgebiete für die
          Rohstoffgewinnung)
        * Industrial and commercial areas of special significance to the state  (existing + planned)
        * Industrial and commercial areas of special significance to the region  (existing + planned)

      ökölogischen Verbundsystems)

.. _re_pv_assumptions:

Further assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* For economic reasons only areas >1 hectare are considered,
* Existing plants and thus used areas are neglected.
* For the specific space requirement, 1.5 hectares per installed megawatt peak (MWp) are assumed. Common values range
  from 1.5 ha/MWp :cite:`ZSW2019` to 2.5 ha/MWp :cite:`BMWi2017a`. Due to efficiency improvements, among other factors,
  a lower space requirement can be assumed in the future (0.8 ha/MWp in 2030 according to :cite:`ZSW2019`). For the
  2035 scenarios a value of 1.0 ha/MWp and for 2050 0.8 ha/MWp is estimated.
* As described above, only a portion of fields and meadows are assumed to be "spatially compatible" :cite:`ZSW2019`.
  Therefore, an upper threshold of 1.0% is assumed here. Date from *CLC* :cite:`CLC2018` shows that the total area of
  arable land and meadows in ABW is 208,578 ha, the maximum available potential area is therefore limited to 2086 ha
  (marked with **(A)** in the result table below).
* Mutual overlaps of potential areas are minimal and therefore neglected.

After clipping the potential with the restrictive areas, eligible areas are determined. They are evaluated on two levels
of restrictions: strict restrictions only and strict+weak restrictions:

Definition of land use scenarios
--------------------------------

Based upon the above potentials four different RE scenarios are defined: **RE-**, **RE**, **RE+** and **RE++** which
reflect different land use configurations and accordingly, different degrees of RE penetration. Each of the global
:ref:`scenarios` is assigned one of these RE scenarios, a full list is given in :ref:`scenario-details-re`.

The analysis of the available area for wind and PV installations already reveals important insights regarding stated
research questions. :numref:`re_power_potential` presents installable capacity of wind and PV for the four land use
scenarios (**Wind+** and **PV+** are integrated into **RE+**) and for each target year.

.. _re_power_potential:
.. figure:: images/RES_power_potential_vs_REx_scenarios.png
   :width: 100 %
   :align: center

   Installable capacity for wind and PV considering four land use scenarios. Capacity is given in GW (wide bars,
   left axis) and relative to the installable capacity under consideration of the current legal status quo (narrow bars,
   right axis), which is applied to determine the capacity for **RE-** scenarios.

On the left hand side, the scenario assuming the lowest capacity installations (**RE-** reflects the current regulatory
status quo. In this comparatively restrictive scenario, the available area for wind turbines and ground-mounted PV is
entirely used and serves as a reference for the relative land use in the other scenarios. For realizing wind turbine
capacity as assumed in **RE** (reflects capacity of *NEP 2035*), 165 % of the available area under current legislation
would be required. This could already be achieved by wind installations in 10 % of not restricted forestal areas.
In order to achieve installations according to *ISE 2050*, it would be necessary to reduce the minimum required distance
of wind turbines from settlements to 500 m. It further becomes clear, that in **RE**, there is sufficient space to
realize the required ground-mounted PV power of *NEP 2035* but not for the targets of *ISE 2050* where the available
area is exceeded by 130 %. For the more ambitious land use restriction scenarios **RE+** and **RE++**, the areas
necessary for wind and ground-mounted PV strongly exceed the designated areas in 2035 as well as in 2050. In all land
use scenarios, the capacity of roof-mounted PV is lower than or equal to the available potential. To sum up, it can be
said that even in the regulatory status quo, the region has space to increase the amount of renewables to a certain
extent, but to reach a deep decarbonization, the designation of further areas is essential.
