Battery storage capacity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The battery storage capacity is determined by scaling with installed RES capacity. The ratio between battery storage capacity
and RES generation capacity is taken from :cite:`NEP2021`. This is also applied to ISE-scenarios using the same ratio,
but RES generation capacity from :cite:`ISE2020`.
Spatially allocation of battery storage capacity follows the same idea down to municipality level
