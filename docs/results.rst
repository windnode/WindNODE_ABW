Summary and conclusions
-----------------------

The expansion of renewables leads to new economic and social challenges, for example grid
congestions and land-use conflicts. This study investigates supply-oriented flexibility options
for the electricity system (i.e. battery storages, power-to-heat, demand-side management) and
their potential to enhance the integration of renewable energy sources into the energy system.
The techno-economic potential is analyzed by using a dispatch optimization energy system model (see :ref:`esm`),
applied to 39 distinct scenarios (see :ref:`scenarios`) that cover various combinations of renewable energy
penetration, degree of autarkic supply, flexibility options, and restrictions on land-use.

Most importantly, we find

* Enough space is available for required wind and PV installations to serve
  at least regional demand with RES
* High potential for energy exports, depending on land use restrictions
* Land use restrictions need to be revised for accessing large-scale RES potential
* Climate neutral scenarios can technically work, even with a high degree of autarky by using flexibility options
* Rather small amount of regional demand is served from national grid
